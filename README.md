"You could play as a colony of vampire loving thralls and their master, or vampire hunters correspondingly."
- Probably Tynan? Maybe? Who knows...

Simple mod that adds a sanguophage faction, something that should probably already be in the game to begin with.

They are naturally enemies to the player and sanguophages that spawn from this faction only spawn with melee weapons, given their natural abilities.

Hopefully now you can become a true vampire hunter, as intended...

Supports Vanilla Races Expanded - Sanguophage by adding the VRE xenotypes to the sanguophage faction.
